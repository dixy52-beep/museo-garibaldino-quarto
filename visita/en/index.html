            <h2>The Homes of the Greats in Genoa</h2>
            <p>
                Genoa, "La Superba" (The Proud One), is not just a vibrant port but also a crossroads of stories and cultures. Explorers, heroes, musicians, and founding fathers have lived among its 'caruggi' (narrow alleys) and palaces. Let's discover together five historic residences that tell the stories of figures who left an indelible mark on history.

        <!-- 1. VILLA SPINOLA (GARIBALDI'S HOME) -->
        <section class="dimora-section" id="villa-spinola">
            <h3>1. Villa Spinola - Garibaldi's Home</h3>
            <img src="/images/villa-spinola.webp" alt="Villa Spinola in Quarto, Garibaldi's home in Genoa" class="dimora-image">
            <p>
                This villa in the Quarto district is a symbolic place of the Risorgimento. It served as the <strong>home and headquarters of Giuseppe Garibaldi</strong> in the decisive weeks before the departure of the Expedition of the Thousand. Here, the "Hero of the Two Worlds" planned the enterprise that would unify Italy. Today, Villa Spinola is home to the <strong>Garibaldi Museum</strong>, a place rich in relics and memories, and an essential stop for anyone wanting to experience the atmosphere of that historic moment.

        <!-- 2. HOUSE OF CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS -->
        <section class="dimora-section" id="casa-colombo">
            <h3>2. House of Christopher Columbus</h3>
            <img src="/images/casa-colombo.webp" alt="The House of Christopher Columbus in Genoa near Porta Soprana" class="dimora-image">
            <p>
                A short walk from Porta Soprana lies the reconstruction of the house where the famous navigator <strong>Christopher Columbus</strong> spent his childhood and youth. Although the original building was destroyed by a bombardment in 1684, this faithful 18th-century reconstruction is now a small museum. By visiting, you can imagine the young Columbus dreaming of oceans and unknown worlds, right within the walls of his hometown.

        <!-- 3. VILLA DEL PRINCIPE -->
        <section class="dimora-section" id="villa-principe">
            <h3>3. Villa del Principe - The Palace of Andrea Doria</h3>
            <img src="/images/villa-principe.webp" alt="The facade of Villa del Principe in Genoa, the residence of Andrea Doria" class="dimora-image">
            <p>
                More than just a villa, this is a true palace overlooking the sea. It was the private residence of admiral and statesman <strong>Andrea Doria</strong>, the most powerful figure in 16th-century Genoa. The Villa del Principe was not part of the Palazzi dei Rolli system because it was a suburban residence, but its magnificence, with frescoes, tapestries, and a monumental garden, makes it one of the most spectacular historic homes in the city.

        <!-- 4. BIRTHPLACE OF GIUSEPPE MAZZINI -->
        <section class="dimora-section" id="casa-mazzini">
            <h3>4. Birthplace of Giuseppe Mazzini</h3>
            <img src="/images/casa-mazzini.webp" alt="The building housing the Risorgimento Museum and Mazzini's birthplace" class="dimora-image">
            <p>
                In the heart of the historic center, on Via Lomellini, stands the building where <strong>Giuseppe Mazzini</strong>, one of the central figures of the Italian Risorgimento, was born. His birthplace is now an integral part of the <strong>Risorgimento Museum</strong> (Museo del Risorgimento), which houses documents, flags, and artifacts related to the history of national unification. It is a place that, along with Garibaldi's home, offers a complete insight into the ideas and actions that created Italy.
            </p>
        </section>

        <!-- 5. PAGANINI'S HOUSE -->
        <section class="dimora-section" id="casa-paganini">
            <h3>5. The (Lost) House of Niccolò Paganini</h3>
            <img src="/images/casa-paganini.webp" alt="Niccolò Paganini's house in Genoa, which was destroyed during the demolition of the Via Madre di Dio district" class="dimora-image">
            <p>
                Not all historic homes survive the test of time. The house where the legendary violinist <strong>Niccolò Paganini</strong> was born, in Passo di Gattamora, no longer exists. It was demolished in the 1970s during the construction of the Piccapietra business district. Today, a commemorative plaque marks the spot where one of the greatest musical geniuses of all time was born, his memory still resonating through the city's streets.
