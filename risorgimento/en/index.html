                    At Villa Spinola, now home to the <a href="https://www.museogaribaldino.it/en/" target="_blank">Garibaldi Museum of Genoa</a>, Giuseppe Garibaldi planned the historic Expedition of the Thousand. This plaque was installed in 1960, on the centenary of the enterprise, to commemorate its departure.

            <p>
                Long before becoming the starting point for the Expedition of the Thousand, Genoa was the beating heart of the Italian Risorgimento. In this city, a crossroads of ideas and trade, the minds and hearts who dreamed of a united, free, and independent Italy were born and worked. It was here that thought turned into action, laying the foundations for the nation we know today.

            <h3>The Great Protagonists of Genoa</h3>
            <p>
                Genoa was not just a stage, but a forge of talents and heroes. The ideas of <strong>Giuseppe Mazzini</strong>, born in the city's narrow alleys, gave a soul to the movement with his Young Italy. The courage of <strong>Giuseppe Garibaldi</strong> found operational support in Genoa for his most daring ventures, planned right at Villa Spinola. Furthermore, poets like <strong>Goffredo Mameli</strong> gave voice to the people's sentiment, composing the anthem that still unites us today.

            <h2>The Thousand: Destiny Sets Sail from Genoa</h2>
            <p>
                On the night between May 5 and 6, 1860, the history of Italy took a decisive turn. From a humble cliff in Quarto, then a small village on the outskirts of Genoa, just over a thousand men led by Giuseppe Garibaldi secretly embarked on two steamships, the <em>Piemonte</em> and the <em>Lombardo</em>. This was not a military parade, but a secret operation, driven by incredible audacity and the hope of uniting a nation.
            </p>
            <p>
                That night, Genoa offered more than just a starting point. It offered its men, its logistical support, and, above all, its indomitable spirit. The "Thousand" were a diverse group of youths, artisans, professionals, and veterans, united not by a uniform, but by Mazzini's ideal of a united Italy. They set sail towards an uncertain destiny, carrying with them the dream of an entire generation, ready to turn it into reality with their courage. The rock of Quarto thus became not just a geographical location, but a universal symbol of audacity and love for the homeland.
